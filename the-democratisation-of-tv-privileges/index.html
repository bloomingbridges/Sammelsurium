  <div class="entry_content"><h3>Inception</h3>

<p>When we were asked to create a piece of media whose playback was somehow influenced by an <em>RSS</em> feed for our second mini project, the initial collective response was something along the lines of &#8220;Not again!&#8221;. To make matters worse, Dr. Lock provided us with a code example, which only needed two minor changes in order for the weakest of students to create something &#8220;acceptable&#8221;. Where&#8217;s the fun in that?</p>

<p>So I teamed up with <a href="https://twitter.com/imaginehonesty">Lizzie Seymour</a> as we shared the sentiment that feeds didn&#8217;t do the module name much justice. Still within the workshop it crystallised that we wanted to experiment with audience participation, to hand the control over to our spectators as in pieces like <a href="http://seb.ly/work/pixelphones/">PixelPhones</a> by Seb Lee-Delisle. For demonstration purposes we&#8217;d stitch together a series of cute kitten videos and make everyone in the room rub their phone screens in order to &#8220;upvote&#8221; their favourite clip.</p>

<p>We tried several JS libraries for picking up gestures in mobile browsers, but couldn&#8217;t find one that picked up more than one finger swipes on the <em>Android</em> default browser reliably. When Simon expressed his growing concern that we&#8217;d get too close to the upcoming assignment in taking the feed out of the equation, we came up with a slightly different scenario: We&#8217;d take the largest source of free video material on the internet available (<em>YouTube</em>), project it onto a wall and gave everyone in the room access to the same remote control. Thus, <em>The democratisation of TV privileges</em> was born.</p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>I feared that if we wanted to go down the <em>Processing</em> route I&#8217;d have to write a script that scraped <em>YouTube</em> for videos and downloaded them in advance. That would have been neither feasible nor very in lign with copyright law, so we decided to stick with web technologies for this one. Luckily <em>YouTube</em>&#8217;s recent update to the Player API allows you to control embedded videos via <em>JavaScript</em>. The original purpose of the <em>chromeless player</em> was to allow for customisation of the controls, little did they know it would make my life much much easier.</p>

<p>Lizzie went off to write the backend, which would generate <em>YouTube</em> playlist for search terms and provide them in human-readable XML. As for the interactive part, I used this project as an excuse to dig deeper into <a href="http://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a> and their implementation of the WebSocket API as I felt this was too big a thing not to have in your toolbelt these days (as our projects in other modules so splendidly demonstrated). I used <a href="http://nodejitsu.com">nodejitsu.com</a> for hosting and <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> for the real-time voting system.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/dotp_test.png" alt="DOTP Layer Cake aesthetic" /></p>

<p>Due to a lucky coincidence during a debugging session I discovered that the latest version of <em>Chrome</em> was able to apply transparency to embedded <em>Flash</em> movies. This meant that I&#8217;d be able to play back all the channels at once, which would make for a more dream-like aesthetic and perhaps even increase the level of immersion.</p>

<h3>Reception &amp; Further development</h3>

<p>It worked out quite well in the end. At least for a two week project. Simon didn&#8217;t seem very impressed, but the crowd loved it.</p>

<p>In the version we presented it was already possible to create new channels on the fly by calling a function from the browser&#8217;s console. That as well as the remote design could do with some love in my opinion. Ideally you also wouldn&#8217;t have to restart the server every time you wanted to have a session, rather you&#8217;d create a theatre of your own using a unique id so you could invite people on the internet to join. Alas, I am fed up with <em>WebSockets</em> and I&#8217;ll gladly hand such tasks to all you enthusiastic tinkerers out there who want to learn and or simply point out what I&#8217;ve been doing wrong (I know for instance that the way I bundled socket.io with the app was completely off). You can find the repository on my <a href="https://github.com/bloomingbridges/YouMote">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To this day I am still not entirely sure whether the struggle with <em>Node</em> was actually worth it. Expecially the package management causes a LOT of confusion in combination with hosting services and writing server-side <em>JavaScript</em> - albeit its familiarity - still seems blatantly pointless.</p>
