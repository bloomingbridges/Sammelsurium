  </header>

  <div class="entry_content"><p>For our second collaboration with the school of architecture we were asked to create something novel that would attract visitors to the ex-mining town St. Blazey, Cornwall. The people of St. Blazey feel a little overshadowed by the surrounding &#8220;metropoles&#8221; St. Austell and Fowey, something the council wants to change by building a museum on the former R&amp;D area of the clay mining grounds, the design of which is - coincidentally - carried out by the architecture students of <em>Plymouth University</em>.</p>

<p>Early on in the project we decided to tackle the social issues that St. Blazey is dealing with, the feeling of disconnectedness and the generation gap. Saul and myself felt strongly that we should make an installation, which would blend into the environment and which would only reveal its interaction by walking past / <a href="http://www.artcom.de/en/projects/project/detail/duality/">over it</a>.</p>

<p>A great way of doing so - we thought - was have people accidentally create harmonic music together by giving them an instrument that doesn&#8217;t require any mastery. Heavily inspired by Justin Windle&#8217;s <a href="http://soulwire.co.uk/experiments/particle-node-sequencer/">Particle Node Sequencer</a> I imagined glowing poles of light in a medium-sized dark room that play back notes whenever people gather around them holding hands, to reference the strong sense of purpose the miners had felt back in the day risking their lives down in the shafts of the St. Blazey clay mines.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/particle_node_sequencer.png" alt="Justin Windle's Particle Node Sequencer" /></p>

<p>A less extravagant, yet more portable solution was to buid a monome or <a href="http://blog.iso50.com/23116/start-making-some-music-right-now/">tone matrix</a> out of illuminated tiles on the floor. To hit two birds with one stone we thought we could have multiple installations, one in each of the neighbouring towns that would allow for remote collaboration, each location being identifiable through their unique colour.</p>

<p>One building in particular within the museum had been recommended to us for the main attraction, a room called the archive. To do the location justice we thought about having a separate room which would house a physical representation of the tunes created via the monomes. After some serious Health &amp; Safety considerations we thought it would be nice to have a transforming floor made up of many little cubes on pistons, covered by a stretchy material.</p>

<p>One week was not enough to create a physical prototype with Arduinos, even going for the smallest matrix possible there was still too much room for error. Hence I suggested to make a virtual prototype using <em>Unity3D</em>, whilst the others would be looking into creating a web version and synthesising music  using the <em>Web Audio API</em>. Getting them to talk to each other resulted in the usual mess of <em>NodeJS</em>, websockets and OSC.</p>
