    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the start of this year I rejoined the <em>Amateur Dramatics</em> society. When the new, more ambitious committee were asking us to submit our own plays for the upcoming christmas showcase, the following ran through my head:</p>

<p>Since I am not anywhere decent at writing I thought I could let my computer write a play more me generating phrases and characters at random. This thought was hugely influenced by my recent experiments with the <a href="http://www.rednoise.org/rita/">RiTa</a> library for Processing, which has made its way into <a href="http://benashman.co.uk/p/birdwire">Birdwire</a> app.</p>

<p>However, since this approach would likely result in complete nonsense, I&#8217;d like to suggest the more sensible <em>Dadaist</em> way: I&#8217;d collect a few public domain plays and have a script pick out phrases and stage instructions and assign them to a fixed amount of characters. Essentially collaging literature, or perhaps even recycling.</p>

<p>The resulting play probably wouldn&#8217;t make the cut, yet I&#8217;m really eager to see one version acted out professionally as this would present quite the challenge to any actor regardless their skill level. Maybe by the time Easter comes along I will have one ready.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My former housemate Rafael used to present me with his latest acquisitions that ranged from retro gaming hardware to iPhone accessories on a weekly basis. The least useful one, a phone handset that plugs into the bi-directional headphone jack of an iPhone, re-entered my trail of thoughts recently as I was thinking about gallery spaces.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/Smoke.jpg" alt="iPhone handset accessory" /></p>

<p>It certainly holds a certain novelty to attach a phone to a phone, but when plugged into a computer for instance it becomes an interface rather than an unwieldy extension. With the help of a sound shield one could have an Arduino play holding or elevator music for eternity through the handset whenever it&#8217;s picked up. With the help of capacitive sensors one could measure the tolerance levels of gallery viewers and visualise them on a nearby wall in one way or other.</p>

<p>I am not taking this anywhere, this entry simply marks the beginning of a series of blog posts where I jot down the more shareworthy ideas that cross my mind.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to Ben and Phil we now got a nice little website featuring an informative short clip up <a href="http://www.benashman.co.uk/p/birdwire">online</a>. You can follow the latest and breaking chitter via <a href="http://www.twitter.com/birdwireapp">@birdwireapp</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/birdwire_site.png" alt="birdwire website" /></p>

<p>Meanwhile I&#8217;ve been busy refactoring my code and adding a couple of features. For instance you can now flip a switch in the interface and the interpreter will match your input against a dictionary and try to make sense of it. This will make for a much more meaningful output.</p>

<p>Furthermore can the Arduino&#8217;s sensor thresholds and other options be set dynamically from within the Processing sketch.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/birdwire_sketch.png" alt="birdwire beta screenshot" /></p>

<p>There are still a couple of edge cases and minor bugs that need my attention, but it will do for the presentation tomorrow. Once I&#8217;m happy I shall release the code to the general public. So if you&#8217;re keen on trying it out for yourself, you can either come along tomorrow, or simply keep an eye on my <a href="http://www.github.com/bloomingbridges">GitHub</a> ;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following up on the idea from last week&#8217;s session of making a game that will let people experience <em>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</em> first-hand, it is now at the time to talk details, visual style in particular.</p>

<p>Simply put, the objective is to walk from the one side of the screen to the other, like in many many other games before. Thankfully, our idea requires just a single platform and only minor modifications to the game engine ;) Now here&#8217;s the catch: Your avatar will die horrible deaths along the way (being stomped by <em>Godzilla</em>, struck by lightning, hit by a bus) at seemingly random moments. This will -  hopefully - make the player (i.e. you) hesitate to progress in the game, thus creating anxiety of the simple task that is crossing the street. Eventually you pass the crossing without any problems whatsoever and only then will you notice that all previous attempts of doing so took place in the character&#8217;s imagination only. The final screen will show some information on the disorder in order - pardon - to raise awareness.</p>

<p>Watson seemed pretty keen to try making some 8-bit retro graphics for the game, which is fine by me as no graphic style seems either more or less suitable for this kind of &#8220;game&#8221;. In order to put the player in a familiar (at least iconic), peaceful and realistic environment I suggested to model the screen after a crossing in New York City. Here&#8217;s moodboard for the setting that I have in mind:</p>

<p>And another one that depicts a variety of retro styles that we might end up with:</p>

    <updated>2012-10-08T01:23:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://bloomingbridges.github.com/Sammelsurium/game-design-101</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tough luck. As students in the year prior complained about having to do too much programming for this module, this time around there will be next to none (at least for the first couple of weeks). Instead of relying on existing Flash skills to create a portfolio-extending piece of interactive art that can be put up on the internet and enjoyed by many, we will be working with Simon&#8217;s JavaScript-based (and rather limited) <a href="https://github.com/DAT303/PUP-Game-Engine">PUP Game Engine</a> for the time being.</p>

<p>And it doesn&#8217;t end here, we also get to do ALL THE THINGS that I spent most of my free time doing anyway: thinking up ideas for games. Heck, I even do it in the shower..
So anyway, let&#8217;s approach this with an open mind and play the game, if you pardon my pun.
We employed a variety of techniques to come up with ideas for a small game, looking at random wikipedia articles being one of them.</p>

<p>Our group stumbled upon the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_(video_game)">Varicella</a> (a text-adventure set in Venice during the Renaissance)</li>
<li>South-East Asia</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder">Generalized anxiety disorder</a> (a disorder akin to severe paranoia)</li>
</ul>


<p>And those combined into the worst possible idea for a game imaginable resulted in:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;An Italian piece of interactive fiction where you have to go into the city of Venice so you can witness your daughter giving birth to her child. Unfortunately you suffer from Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, so throughout the game you forget about commands, items you collected, your whereabouts or even how to spell.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The one-legged hamster that has to prevent the JFK assassination from happening was another one of my favourites. All jokes aside, I think we&#8217;ll be sticking to our original idea, which I happen to talk about in more detail in another blog post.</p>

<p>As a final thought experiment we&#8217;ve been asked to try and combine our two favourite games and think of how something like that could actually made possible. In my case that would be <em>Thirty Flights of Loving</em> and <em>Wipeout</em>, a narrative-heavy racing game in which you hardly ever get to control a vehicle. Oh and of course jumpcuts! :D</p>

<p>Later on I came across this gem by accident, hidden deep within the depths of the University library: <em>How to make Things with Videogames</em> by Ian Bogost. So far I can only recommend it.</p>

    <id>http://bloomingbridges.github.com/Sammelsurium/a-twitter-client-for-birds</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/birdhouse_infrographic.jpg" alt="birdhouse design" /></p>

<p>So how does one go about creating an interface for a twitchy little animal? We figured all it needs is a familiar environment (a birdhouse), a handful of seeds and a tiny microphone. Thanks to Anish&#8217;s connections we got the housing covered, the sound sensor we borrowed from the <em>i-DAT</em> office. The birdhouse turned out a little bigger than expected. Field tests will show whether we have to find another &#8220;target audience&#8221;;</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/birdwire_development.jpg" alt="birdwire development" /></p>

<p>A first dirty implementation of a Morse code interpreter in Processing revealed a fundamental problem with the approach. A quick recap. In Morse, the characters are distinguished by a unique sequence of dots (DIT) and dashes (DAHs, three times the length of a DIT). To signal the end of a character you pause for the length of three DITs or one DAH, significantly longer for a word break. This all requires timing, which the birds don&#8217;t necessarily care for, so the pause length needs to be variable.</p>

<p>In version #1 every sound above a certain threshold would generate a DIT. I would start listening for periods of pauses until I picked up a new peck. After a certain amount of inactivity I will insert a space character. As some characters end on DITs and others on DITs plus two pauses I will never be able to tell what the last character of the word was, this way the birdies only ever get to choose from half of the letters available.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/birdwire_screenshot.png" alt="birdwire v.0.1 screenshot" /></p>

<p>I propose another algorithm that requires two different inputs, they may even come from the same sensor just using slightly different thresholds. It also wouldn&#8217;t hurt to ensure that at least one character is detected for every input session. If the bird flies off before the tweet is finished, should it be sent out anyway? Should incoming data be collected, averaged and thresholds dynamically adjusted according to different species of birds? To answer these questions we need to test it out in the open, which isn&#8217;t exactly feasible for next week. Unless someone&#8217;s got a 20m long USB extension cable that is?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looks like I&#8217;m having a bit of a lucky streak this week as I keep stumbling upon scarily relevant resources on the internet. Of course I will be sharing them with you lot.</p>

<p>Next up: This <em>rhizome</em> article, <a href="http://rhizome.org/editorial/2012/oct/2/insert-disc-digital-flaneurs-guide/">INSERT Disc: A digital flaneur&#8217;s guide</a>, which presents us with a novel way of embedding data into buildings, thus relating beautifully to our exploration of ubiquitous computing in the <em>Everyware</em> (DAT302) module.</p>

<p>The gist is that the <a href="http://www.movingimage.us">Museum of the Moving Image</a> in Long Island City has installed a slot-loading optical drive on one side of its walls where you can insert a blank DVD. A couple of minutes later, it will spit out a free archive - in the form of a virtual disk image - of visual art history for you to immerse yourself in.</p>

<p>I find this project fascinating for two reasons: It stays true to the original medium those works were originally distributed in and I really like the thought that the building&#8217;s walls supposedly have amassed this collection of memories of art exhibited in the museum over its lifetime.</p>

    <id>http://bloomingbridges.github.com/Sammelsurium/morse-code</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To kick off <em>Real-time</em> we were asked to work on a series of mini projects that involve sensory input and the good old Arduino. When thinking about what invisible data source I&#8217;d like to give a &#8216;voice&#8217;, the first thing that comes to my mind is <em>silence</em>. I like the idea of rewarding people with visuals under the rare moments of complete silence.</p>

<p>After <em>Lee Nutbean</em> introduced us to the <a href="http://www.i-dat.org/eco-os-workshop-ecoid-prototype/">ecoid</a>, a self-sustaining sensor kit that transmits its collected data wirelessly, I fondled with the idea of installing a couple of speakers in the shape of birdhouses around campus.</p>

<p>The speakers would continously play back lists of messages encoded in morse, a series of sounds that only the ones in the know would be able to make sense of. It shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to write an app that would listen to the beeps and decode the messages, or even feed into the system by lighting up the flash on the phone camera in time. Thus creating some kind of local area secret pigeonhole system.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code">Morse Code</a> ever since I fell for Google&#8217;s brilliant <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/01/gmail-tap-google-april-fools-day_n_1394635.html">April Fools&#8217; joke</a> of 2012. In my mind there was no doubt that the Morse Code keyboard was a brilliant idea.</p>

<p>Ultimately we came up with another idea in our group that utilises Morse in a different way: We are going to build a twitter client. For birds. And it&#8217;s going to be called <em>birdwire</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/birdwire_logo.png" alt="birdwire logo" /></p>

<p><strong>EDIT 21.10.2012</strong></p>

<p>Today I learned that <em>morse</em> is French for <em>walrus</em>, a piece of information which mandated me to create the following work of nonsense:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/code_de_morse.jpg" alt="walrus code" /></p>

<p>Actually this tied in beautifully with my recent attempts to re-learn and master <em>blender</em>, the outcomes of which I shall document in another blog post in the near future.</p>

    <id>http://bloomingbridges.github.com/Sammelsurium/inspiration-visualising-sound</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Feeding into the discussion on the plethora of ways in which we can combine visuals and sound, which happens to tie in nicely with our reading material for the <em>Real-time</em> module (<a href="http://localhost:4000/Sammelsurium/blog/categories/dat301/">DAT301</a>), I would like to share with you two delightful examples of such practice:</p>

<p>First in line is a literal interpretation of the song &#8216;Dynamics of the Subway&#8217; by the Japanese band <a href="http://www.haisuinonasa.com/">haisuinonasa</a> through <a href="http://www.creativeapplications.net/sound/keita-onishi-forest-and-trees-dynamics-of-the-subway/">Keita Onishi</a>. Starting out as a Fischinger-esque translation of beat and notes (kicks, piano chords) into simple geometric shapes, the graphical elements soon transform into an underground car racing through the most colourful world of black and white that I have ever witnessed.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/49367868?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=1" width="100%" height="394" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>The second piece I discovered when querying the university library database for the works of my favourite visual artist <a href="http://www.ryojiikeda.com/">Ryoji Ikeda</a>. His research project <a href="http://www.ryojiikeda.com/project/other/">cyclo. id vol.1</a> represents the other end of the spectrum, where stereo sound is interpreted in real-time through an oscilloscope and remapped onto different coordinates. Said tome is just an immense collection of such computationally-generated representations and thus not really interesting per se, yet the accompanying disc holds some rather fascinating animated examples.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/cyclo.gif" alt="cyclo." /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been obsessed with Japanese design and visual culture as of late (if you couldn&#8217;t already tell), so the domination of Japanese artists potrayed in this post may not be entirely coincidental. In an attempt to learn at least the basic 48 kana I started playing <a href="http://www.hiraganapixelparty.com/HiraganaPixelParty.html">Hiragana Pixel Party</a>, a rhythm-based language acquisition game for iOS and Windows Phone. And take note, the university is offering a four-week beginner-level course in Japanese over the summer. Why am I telling you this? I could do with a learning partner in order to make it more fun, that&#8217;s all ^^</p>

<p>Whilst out-in-the-open work with strangers has thus far only enabled me to produce less than mediocre work (I&#8217;m watching you Nutbean!), I am looking forward to the interfacultary collaboration nevertheless. After all, the subject of architecture is very dear to my heart and having a module that essentially requires you to pick up cyberpunk novels for research is more than welcome :></p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1.10.2012</strong></p>

<p>One author that I think Gianni has mentioned during the intro session - Howard Rheingold - just released a book with TED titled <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/09/30/howard-rheingolds-mind-a.html">Mind Amplifier</a> and it&#8217;s only three quid for the ebook version.</p>
