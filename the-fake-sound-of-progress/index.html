  <div class="entry_content"><p>Over the weekend we&#8217;ve had our first major breakdown: In talking to the high-schoolers (our potential audience) last Friday it crystallised that they weren&#8217;t even aware of the wall&#8217;s existence nor did they show much interest in learning about its rich history.</p>

<p>We were also worried that we didn&#8217;t have enough data to play with, so Ben wrote a web interface that allowed locals to <a href="http://datwall.herokuapp.com/">submit their memories of the wall to a database</a> whilst I, mostly due to a lack of direction, started writing a framework for displaying different types of media from said database in <em>Processing</em>. This way we could have miniature bricks cut from the Devonport wall, each housing an RFID tag, which could then be reassembled in a variety of ways while at the same time displaying their content.</p>

<p>We thought we were on the right track with this one. Once our database was in place, teachers could associate bricks with their own teaching material and use the visualisation as a presentation tool.</p>

<p>At the same time, our architect Miguel kept coming up with new designs for our space, which kept pushing the project into all kinds of wrong directions on a daily basis. One element that persisted throughout however, was the use of miniature bricks as an interface to a projection / installation.</p>

<p>At the time there was a lot of confusion over the brief as well. It read &#8220;design for an outdoor learning space&#8221;, but all we got were sketches for an indoor auditorium and hallways. Future-proof you say? Does it even need to relate to the wall at all? Why does the assignment for group 3a and b look so drastically different, but offer only limited additional information?</p>

<p>So we thought and fought about it some more and we eventually came up with an idea that would work in any type of environment and which would not be concerned with the Devonport wall so much: We&#8217;d teach kids about the environment and how the wall was just a metaphor for recycling.</p>

<p>And since we&#8217;re at it, why not throw a competitive element into the mix? It literally blew my mind when I learned that schools in England are divided up in houses like in the <em>Harry Potter</em> universe. What all this means will require another blog entry to explain. Flo out.</p>
