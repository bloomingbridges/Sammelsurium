  <div class="entry_content"><h3>Project 1b workshop: 5/10/12 – 19/10/12</h3>

<p><strong>a) Explain three things which you have learnt from this workshop.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The way architecture is taught is much more free-form (open workspaces, constant tutoring) and even in a field so specific you still have the choice to do whatever you want.</p></li>
<li><p>Architects care a lot about materials and finding the right texture for things whereas we DAT students seem to be more concerned with the invisible.</p></li>
<li><p>Their conceptual nature gets in the way of our nature of building things. You cannot force collaboration onto people, it has to happen naturally for mutual reasons.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>b) What are three things which could have been better/improved upon?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The briefs could have been less wordy and more concise, especially in places where they differed for groups and even team members.</p></li>
<li><p>The workshops could have been better integrated into each other&#8217;s curriculum. For the most time it felt as if our work was just sugar-coating and not very fundamental as the architects already had a head start on designing the buildings. This mismatch of expectations plus the fact that we got assessed on different presentations lead to a massive loss of interest in either side&#8217;s work.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people might benefit from an introduction into basic computer skills.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>c) Did you find the project challenging? Explain if so and why.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I did find the projects challenging, however made unnecessarily challenging by the vagueness of the brief given. Too much time was wasted re-evaluating our ideas against the marking criteria and the relevance to the module content.</p>

<p><strong>d) After the workshop experience, how would you define a site?</strong></p>

<p>A site is more than just a location on a map. It is a self-contained space, always in transition and a playground for artists. Any site benefits from meaning that it receives through contacts with humans.</p>

<p><strong>e) What is your now current understanding of ubiquitous computing?</strong></p>

<p>See my post <a href="http://bloomingbridges.github.com/Sammelsurium/ubicomp-seminar-afterthoughts/">UbiComp Seminar afterthoughts</a></p>

<p><strong>f) How did you engage your course skills to the task? (field of DAT or Architecture)</strong></p>

<p>I picked up a lot of knowledge on computer graphics and more specifically <em>Unity3D</em> in a short amount of time for the prototype. Figuring out how to make two things talk to each other that otherwise would not (Arduino and NodeJS, NodeJS and Processing/Unity) under pressure was key and it took some exerience to be able to tell what would and what wouldn&#8217;t work from a technical perspective.</p>
