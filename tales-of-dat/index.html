  <div class="entry_content"><p>The confusion began Thursday night with an email from Gianni prompting us to fill out a survey before the next session Friday morning. The first question &#8220;How would you define a sight&#8221; turned into a conundrum after I submitted it last-minute and Catherine used the word <em>site</em> extensively in her briefing.</p>

<p>On the topic of briefing, our first assignment this term would be to consider barriers and the implications of removing them. More specifically, we&#8217;d be working with a live brick wall that divides Devonport from the <em>Royal Dockyard</em>, which has been erected during the 1950s and separated communities and made getting from point A to B a bother ever since. The Devonport council&#8217;s intent is to remove the wall completely by 2013 and to give our architects and us the opportunity to build a new learning space for the <em>Devonport High School for Boys</em> from the rubble.</p>

<p>To get a better idea of what we were dealing with, we all took the bus down to Devonport and gathered around the rather exotic looking area around the guildhall. Equipped with iPads that lacked internet connectivity and a handful of QR-code that had been printed off the internet we were asked to create content around the area and attach it to the wall using the fishy looking <a href="http://www.talesofthings.com">Tales of Things</a> app.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/tot.jpg" alt="Tales of Things logo" /></p>

<p>Maybe if it had not started pouring down then that would have been indeed a good team-building exercise. On the other hand, since our group needed to be concerned with the re-purposing of the wall&#8217;s parts after its demolition rather than the current state of affairs we spent most of our expedition time debating the brief.</p>

<p>We came to the conclusion that it might be a good idea to create a large-scale jigsaw puzzle out of the wall&#8217;s bricks. Whenever a specific set of bricks is combined to a bigger picture, media could be overlayed in some way or other, similar to recent efforts of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nJy9MjhXvQ">Ravensburger</a> to make their products more engaging.</p>

<p>The trip took one last unexpected turn for the worse when we and another group were asked to walk to the other end of Devonport, so we could crowd-source ideas for our project from ten-year-olds. Lots of confused faces on both sides spoke volumes.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Sunday now and my initial anger over the first Everyware assignment has mostly worn off. Miraculously I managed to not catch a cold, still, this report should serve as a reminder for how it&#8217;s definitely <strong>not</strong> done.</p>
