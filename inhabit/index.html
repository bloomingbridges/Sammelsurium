  <div class="entry_content"><p>One of the benefits of the close partnership between the course and <em>IBM</em> is their <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/uk">Smarter Planet</a> workshop they hold for us final year students once a year. It&#8217;s a chance to have your idea evaluated by an industry giant whose initiative is to make the world a better place. What&#8217;s not to like? Probably the fact that every idea you will come up with during the workshop is either already being done or will <a href="http://moorescloud.com">hit the market soon</a>.</p>

<p>Luckily, we identified a series of issues within our own household that could be easily resolved through smartification. What we aim to improve is the relationship between friends or strangers living together by minimising the window for confrontation and making their everyday more efficient / convenient. Here are some example scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m returning home and I wasn&#8217;t aware that my housemate dead-locked the door when he left the house earlier so I stand there on the doorstep looking rather confused for a minute. <em>What if the house would automatically double-lock the door after the last person has left and unlock for me as I approach it?</em></p></li>
<li><p>Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m at university and I&#8217;m expecting a delivery. <em>If only I could tell whether any of my housemates are home that afternoon to receive the package, so I could send them a notice. I don&#8217;t have their phone numbers? No problem, the system would take care of that.</em></p></li>
<li><p>One big cause for quarrel in shared accommodation is the thermostat, as throughout the day inhabitants will adjust it according to their preference. <em>How about the house would adjust the heating automatically, keeping the room temperature at a level that suits everyone?</em></p></li>
<li><p>Assuming you have a housemate who sometimes falls asleep watching films on a volume that makes it hard for you to work or sleep next door. <em>That&#8217;s a no-brainer, just have the house turn off the television once it senses the housemate has fallen asleep! Likewise if I wanted to listen to music, ignoring the fact that other inhabitants might be asleep the system could inform me of my inconsiderate  behaviour.</em></p></li>
<li><p>It was housemate B&#8217;s turn to take the bins out today, but apparently he&#8217;s either forgot or doesn&#8217;t care. <em>If the system would remind him or her in the morning and display this information somehwere for everybody to see he or she might feel more inclined to do it.</em></p></li>
<li><p>If I was going to make tea or coffee and quickly wanted to ask around the house whether anybody would want some. <em>This could happen via a single button press on my phone.</em></p></li>
<li><p>At the moment we all do our shopping individually, whereas we could save a considerate amount of money buying in bulk and ordering groceries online. <em>A central shopping list, which was aware of who put what item on would be able to work out the invidual bills in no time and would even be able to stock up on common used items like toilet paper before they run out.</em></p></li>
</ul>


<p>This can all be done using a couple of sensors (RFID, heat, movement), web technologies and geolocation or RFID keyrings. We call our system <strong>INHABIT</strong>. It will live on a central server in your house and is exposed via a myriad of interfaces: an app on the individual&#8217;s phone, a display mounted in the hallway or maybe the television set in the living room.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/monitor_screenshot.png" alt="INHABITor screenshot" /></p>

<p>And it doesn&#8217;t end here. There is lots of scope for additions due to the modular nature of the system. One could, for instance, choose to share one&#8217;s public calendar with <strong>INHABIT</strong>, so it can make better predictions on what time you&#8217;ll be home.</p>

<p>Naturally there will be people, who are concerned about their privacy and would rather not share their exact whereabouts with acquaintances her or she happens to live with. This is why we obfuscate sensitive data and provide  individual privacy control settings.</p>

<p>For our prototype we chose to implement presence using <em>RFID</em> keychains, the individual&#8217;s newsfeeds (using the <em>MQTT</em> protocol to send notifications to and from a <em>Node</em> server, communicating with the mobile web app and the monitor website) and a simple intelligence that would adjust the heating depending on who is home, inform you of sleeping housemates when you enter through the door and allow you to send tea calls around.</p>

<p>For a one-week project it&#8217;s been quite ambitious and with so many possibilities at hand it can be difficult to tell where one should draw the line. Turns out we did just the right amount as <strong>INHABIT</strong> was voted the best project and won us each a bag of <em>IBM</em>-branded stuff.</p>

<p>So far it&#8217;s been the most seamless group work we&#8217;ve done for this module as it was really simple to divide up tasks. I must also say that I thoroughly enjoyed working on something genuinely useful for a change.</p>
