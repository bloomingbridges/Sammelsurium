    <h2 class="entry_title">A taste of Unity</h2>
    
  </header>

  <div class="entry_content"><p>In anticipation of the upcoming <em>DAT301</em> workshop in immersive 3D and the variety of use cases for other assignments  that keep forming in front on my inner eye I started looking into the popular Danish game engine by the name of <em>Unity3D</em>.</p>

<p>When you open up the application for the first time you&#8217;re greeted by a fairly complex demo project (in the case of version 3.5b, <em>Angry Bots</em>) nested within an array of hideous-looking grey panels. On top of those floats a window that claims to hold all the information one needs to get up and running. Granted, moving around in the 3D scene view works like a charm (using 3Ds Max-style hotkeys Q,W,E,R for navigating, translating, rotating and scaling) and is way more intuitive than other 3D packages that I had the displeasure to work with lately.</p>

<p>Then came shock number two: No coding tutorial? You&#8217;re not even going to tell me how to rotate a cube around itself? Panic-stricken I clicked around the interface looking for clues. It appeared as if the general workflow of a unity developer consisted solely of buying models from the <em>Asset Store</em> and placing them into a scene. This certainly wasn&#8217;t a very pleasing thought and I refused to accept it as true since I have watched the <a href="http://www.indiebuskers.net">indiebuskers</a> make games with <em>Unity</em>, spending most of their time in MonoDevelop or Visual Studio, there must be another way..</p>

<p>When I happened to fall ill over the weekend I spent a whole day just watching all the <em>Unity</em> video tutorials I could find on <em>YouTube</em> from the comfort of my bed. Filled to the brim with new knowledge I gave it another shot and made my model of a walrus head rotate on top of a particle system. Sweet!</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/mondrian.png" alt="Mondrian le Morse" /></p>

<p>Importing models including textures was surprisingly pain-free. My weapon of choice was C#, although I noticed that <em>Unity</em>&#8217;s implementation of <em>JavaScript</em> seems to be more closely related to the <em>ActionScript</em> standard due to the use of static typing, which I like. Long time <em>Flash</em> devs even reported a similarity in their workflow which I can see to an extent. The way it works is you import your assets and attach so called &#8220;behaviours&#8221; to them, little scripts that each contain their own Init and Update loop (yes, all function names a capitalised..). You can save your script-laden asset as a &#8220;prefab&#8221; (think <em>MovieClip</em>), which you can then drag into the scene or instantiate through another script.</p>

<p>What took some time to adjust to, however, was that everything is based on vectors (i.e. you can&#8217;t just move an object two units to the left, but have to provide a new vector for its position), but that&#8217;s only a small sacrifice compared to learning WebGL and doing everything without an instant representation. This is actually really nice, once you pressed the play button you can inspect all the elements in your scene and make adjustments. This makes debugging a breeze.</p>

<p>Now to try something more challenging. How about I try to use it with a wiimote? Nope, you need the Pro version for that. Kinect? Pro version required. Hmm.. Shadows? Pro version! Can I at least get the dark interface skin? Sorry, no. So I went and acquired a student licence from the official reseller for the upcoming and much appraised version 4, which luckily only turned out to be around £90 rather than the full price of £1500.</p>

<p>In the end I regained my faith in the software (albeit the fact that it wouldn&#8217;t let me open the new version due to popular demand) and you may expect a lot more 3D work from me in the near future (or at least until my licence runs out).</p>
